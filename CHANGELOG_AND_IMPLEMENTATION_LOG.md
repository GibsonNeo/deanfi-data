## [2025-11-22] - Cloudflare R2 Integration & Documentation

### Added

#### 1. Documentation Files
- **DEVELOPER_REQUIREMENTS.md**: Complete developer guide covering:
  - Repository purpose and architecture
  - Data pipeline flow from collectors → Git → R2 → consumers
  - Directory structure and data format standards
  - GitHub Actions workflow configuration
  - Cloudflare R2 setup and access patterns
  - Best practices and troubleshooting guide

- **CHANGELOG_AND_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md** (this file): Implementation tracking

#### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/sync-to-r2.yml`

**Purpose**: Automatically sync only changed JSON files to Cloudflare R2 bucket

**Features**:
- Triggers on push to `main` branch when `*.json` files change
- Detects which files actually changed using `git diff`
- Uploads only modified files to R2 (not entire directory)
- Uses Wrangler CLI for R2 uploads
- Includes error handling and upload verification
- Concurrent workflow protection to prevent conflicts

**Required GitHub Secrets** (Organization or Repository level):
1. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID
2. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - API token with R2 read/write permissions
3. `R2_BUCKET_NAME` - Name of your R2 bucket (e.g., `deanfi-data`)

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Checkout repository with 2-commit history for diff
2. Detect changed JSON files using `git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD`
3. Install Wrangler CLI globally
4. Upload each changed file to R2 bucket using `wrangler r2 object put`
5. Report upload status (success or failure)

**Configuration**:
```yaml
env:
  R2_BUCKET_NAME: deanfi-data  # Change if using different bucket name
```

#### 3. README.md Updates

**Section Added**: "Cloudflare R2 Access"
- Documented R2 public URL access pattern
- Provided custom domain setup guidance
- Included example code for fetching from R2
- Added performance benefits vs GitHub raw URLs

**Section Updated**: "Quick Start"
- Added R2 as preferred data source
- Maintained GitHub raw URL examples for backward compatibility
- Documented caching strategies for R2 access

### Implementation Details

#### Architecture Decision: Git-First Approach

**Why Git remains primary storage**:
1. Version control and audit trail
2. Easy rollback and history tracking
3. Existing collector workflows unchanged
4. R2 serves as CDN/cache layer, not source of truth

**Data Flow**:
```
Collectors (Python) 
  → Git commit (only changed files)
  → GitHub Action detects changes
  → Uploads changed files to R2
  → Consumers fetch from R2
```

#### Performance Benefits

**R2 vs GitHub Raw URLs**:
- **Latency**: R2 ~50ms vs GitHub Raw ~200-500ms (global edge network)
- **Throughput**: R2 has no rate limits vs GitHub's 5000 req/hour for authenticated
- **Cost**: R2 free egress to Cloudflare services vs potential GitHub API limits
- **Caching**: R2 built-in edge caching vs manual cache implementation

#### Selective Upload Strategy

**Git Diff Approach**:
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD | grep '\.json$'
```

**Benefits**:
- Only uploads files that actually changed in the commit
- Reduces upload time (important for 15-min update frequency)
- Minimizes R2 write operations
- Prevents unnecessary object versioning

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- No files changed: Workflow exits gracefully
- Multiple files changed: Loops through all changed files
- Upload failure: Reports error but continues with remaining files

### Configuration Guide

#### Step 1: Create Cloudflare R2 Bucket

1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Navigate to **R2 Object Storage**
3. Click **Create bucket**
4. Bucket name: `deanfi-data`
5. Enable **Public access** (for direct fetching)

#### Step 2: Generate API Token

1. Navigate to **My Profile** → **API Tokens**
2. Click **Create Token**
3. Select **Create Custom Token**
4. Permissions:
   - Account: `R2 Read & Write`
   - Zone Resources: Not needed
5. Continue to summary
4. Repository access: Select `deanfi-data` or all repos

#### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

**For Organization Secrets** (recommended):
1. Navigate to Organization Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Click **New organization secret**
3. Add three secrets:
   - Name: `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
     Value: Your account ID (found in R2 dashboard URL)
   - Name: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
     Value: API token from Step 2
   - Name: `R2_BUCKET_NAME`
     Value: Your bucket name (e.g., `deanfi-data`)
4. Repository access: Select `deanfi-data` or all repos

**For Repository Secrets** (alternative):
1. Navigate to Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add the same three secrets as above

#### Step 4: Enable Public Access (Optional)

1. In R2 bucket settings, go to **Settings** tab
2. Under **Public access**, click **Allow Access**
3. Note the public URL: `https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev`

#### Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In R2 bucket settings, go to **Settings** tab
2. Under **Custom Domains**, click **Connect Domain**
3. Enter domain: `data.deanfinancials.com`
4. Add DNS CNAME record as instructed
5. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)

### Testing

#### Test Workflow Locally

Not possible - R2 uploads require Cloudflare API, must test via GitHub Actions.

#### Test Workflow on GitHub

1. Make a minor change to any JSON file (add a space)
2. Commit and push to `main` branch
3. Navigate to **Actions** tab
4. Watch `Sync to Cloudflare R2` workflow run
5. Verify upload success in logs
6. Check R2 bucket dashboard for updated file timestamp

#### Verify R2 Access

```bash
# Test public access (replace with your bucket URL)
curl https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev/daily-news/top_news.json

# Test custom domain (if configured)
curl https://data.deanfinancials.com/daily-news/top_news.json

# Verify JSON structure
curl https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev/daily-news/top_news.json | jq '.metadata'
```

### Known Limitations

1. **Git history required**: Workflow needs at least 2 commits to detect changes
   - **Impact**: Initial repository setup may need manual upload
   - **Workaround**: Run workflow manually with `workflow_dispatch` for first upload

2. **Large files**: Git has 100MB file limit
   - **Impact**: Historical data files must stay under 100MB
   - **Mitigation**: Archive old data or use pagination

3. **Sync delay**: ~30-60 seconds from commit to R2 availability

## Issue Resolution Log

### 2025-11-23: Local vs Remote R2 Upload Issue

**Problem**: Initial workflow run appeared successful (26/26 files uploaded) but files were not visible in R2 bucket dashboard or accessible via API.

**Root Cause**: Wrangler 4.50.0+ defaults to **local mode** for R2 operations. Workflow logs showed `Resource location: local` despite `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variables being set correctly. Files were uploaded to GitHub Actions runner's local storage instead of Cloudflare R2.

**Solution**: Added `--remote` flag to wrangler command:
```bash
wrangler r2 object put "$R2_BUCKET_NAME/$file" --file="$file" --remote
```

**Verification**: After fix, workflow logs should display:
```
Resource location: remote
```
Instead of `Resource location: local`

**Impact**: All previous uploads to R2 need to be re-run after workflow update.
   - **Impact**: Brief window where Git and R2 are out of sync
   - **Mitigation**: Consumers should implement graceful fallback to GitHub raw URLs

### 2025-11-22: Authentication Clarification & Workflow Validation Step

**Problem**: Continued `403 Forbidden` and Authentication error `10000` responses when using `wrangler r2 object put` despite adding `--remote` flag. Attempts used R2 S3-style Access Keys (Access Key ID / Secret Access Key) in place of Cloudflare API Tokens.

**Root Cause**: Wrangler `r2` subcommands (e.g., `wrangler r2 object put`, `wrangler r2 bucket list`) authenticate via Cloudflare API Tokens (OAuth or API Token with appropriate scopes), not via R2 S3 access keys. The S3 access keys only work against the S3-compatible endpoint (`https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`) using S3 clients. Passing the R2 Secret Access Key as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` results in failed authorization.

**Resolution**:
1. Create a Cloudflare API Token (Dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Custom Token).
2. Assign permissions: `Account R2 Storage:Edit` (grants read & write) – least privilege sufficient for bucket/object operations.
3. Store token as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secret; keep `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `R2_BUCKET_NAME` unchanged.
4. Added new workflow step `Verify Cloudflare authentication & bucket access` executing `wrangler whoami` and `wrangler r2 bucket list --remote` before uploads.
5. Strengthened upload step with `set -euo pipefail` and added bucket info diagnostic on first failure.

**Workflow File Updated**: `.github/workflows/sync-to-r2.yml`
**Change Summary**:
- Added pre-upload auth validation step.
- Added explanatory note differentiating API Tokens vs R2 S3 access keys.
- Early failure with clear messaging if bucket not visible or token invalid.
- Added diagnostic bucket info fetch on first object upload failure.

**Impact**:
- Prevents misleading "successful" local-mode uploads with wrong credentials.
- Speeds troubleshooting by surfacing misconfiguration before looped uploads.

**Verification Instructions**:
Run manual dispatch of workflow; confirm log contains:
```
✅ Wrangler whoami succeeded. Listing buckets...
✅ Bucket 'deanfi-data' accessible. Proceeding with uploads.
```
Followed by remote upload successes.

**Future Consideration**: Optionally rename secret to `CLOUDFLARE_R2_API_TOKEN` for clarity, but deferred to avoid churn.
